         <h2>Get to know me</h2>  
         <p>My name is Nayeli Zapata Reyes. I was born and raised in <a class="pinos" href="https://www.zacatecastravel.com/detalle_pueblomagico.php?pm=4" target="_blank"><em>Pinos Zacatecas, Mexico.</em> </a> 
            I moved to the USA in May of  2009.<br>
            I Lived in the state of Minnesota for seven months. Later on, I moved to Idaho. Since, I have grown roots in Idaho,  and I <br>
            call Idaho home.
         </p>  
         
         <p>Living in Idaho for the past 13 years has allowed me to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. 
            The beauty when <br>changing through the four seasons is much appreciated and enjoyed. I have to admit that witnessing those changes is 
            one<br> of my favorite things to enjoy in life. 
            Also, I have been able to start fun activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, riding <br>four-wheelers,
             and enjoying the art of riding a mountain bike going up and downhill. 
         </p>

         <p>I have learned to overcome challenges, such as learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, and accepting limitations. <br>
            Therefore, I have learned that many difficulties in life are not chosen, but other challenges can be chosen and all can be overcome. <br>
            That is my reason to get into the world of programming. I have decided that I can be successful and input my knowledge and <br>
            experience in the technology industry. An industry that only keeps growing, an industry that only helps me to keep growing.
